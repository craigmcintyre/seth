| 1.2.0   | 2020-01-08 | • Added support for results to be written out in junit xml format. <br>• Added support for recursive testList files (a testList file can refer to other testList files). <br>• Fixed an off-by-one error. <br>• Updated: RapidsDB JDBC driver to version 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT, being one that supports query cancellation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1.1.0   | 2019-06-04 | • Added the SHUFFLE command. <br>• Added scoring of expected rows when an actual row does not match any expected rows in an unordered rows expected statement. <br>• Actual and expected rows are now column aligned when they are printed in an error condition. <br>• Added the command line option, --record, to rewrite a test file with new expected results coming from the actual results by the execution of the test file. <br>• Added the command line option, --nostop, to override the default test behaviour of stopping a test if one of the steps fails (thanks Rich). <br>• Added the command line option, --unordered, to override any ordered rows expected results to be unordered rows instead (thanks Rich). <br>• Added the command line option, --round N, to automatically round any decimal or floating point values (both actual and expected) to N decimal places before they are compared (thanks Rich). <br>• Seth jar file is minimised to reduce file size. <br>• Added support for specifying column names in an expected result set. <br>• Updated: RapidsDB JDBC driver to version 3.0.0, being the one that supports authentication. |
| 1.0.4   | 2017-10-09 | • Added the ability to specify expected results in a separate file. <br>• Added the expected results "failure contains: <msg>", "failure suffix: <msg>" and "failure prefix: <msg>".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
